# Chaotic-Phasors
Attempt at Quantum-Proof Encryption utilizing Chaos systems

Utilizing a unique phasor system to create "signitures" (sum of phasors at any given T, right side) that can be easily verified given private-key starting conditions (phasors, left side), which can collide "cross-fire" stlye. Can perfectly re-run in microseconds, would take many universes to brute force. Can optionally scale up phasors, circles, and other elements to make it even more mind-boggling complicated

To-Do list:
-Test for complexity
-Consider incorporating # of collisions as some sort of metric
